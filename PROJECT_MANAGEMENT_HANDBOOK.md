# WE BUILD Consortium - Project Management Handbook

GitHub is used in the WE BUILD consortium for technology collaboration. It enables Work Packages (WPs) to jointly develop, review, and manage technical artefacts such as specifications, interfaces, test environments, source code etc. This policy defines how GitHub is used across the consortium to ensure efficiency, transparency, and secure handling of shared resources.

## Purpose

To establish a common framework for using GitHub to support collaborative technical work, version control, and documentation while maintaining traceability, accountability, and compliance with project governance and data-protection principles.

## Governance and Structure

- The consortium GitHub organisation (https://github.com/webuild-consortium/) hosts all repositories used for technical collaboration.
- Each WP or Groups within the WP maintains its own repositories for managing specifications, APIs, test tools, and example implementations.
- Repository management and structure are coordinated by the Technical Coordinator in collaboration with the WP Leads.
- Each repository should include a README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING guide, and supporting documentation.

## Access and Roles

- Members must use own GitHub accounts
- Roles include: Owner, Admins (WP and/or Group Leads), Maintainers, and Contributors
- Access rights are reviewed regularly to ensure correct permissions and compliance.

## Working Practices

- Use standard branches: *main* (stable), *develop* (integration), and *feature* (new work).
- All contributions are made through Pull Requests (PRs) reviewed by another partner and linked to Issues.
- Issues are used for tracking technical progress, documenting discussions, and managing updates.
- Version tags (for example, v1.0.0) should be used to mark important milestones or releases.

## Security and Compliance

- Repositories are private unless explicitly approved for public access.
- No personal or sensitive data may be stored in GitHub.
- All partners must comply with consortium data-management and GDPR requirements.

## Archival and Reporting

Each WP Lead is responsible for maintaining repository structure and ensuring updates are properly documented. At project closure, repositories are archived under the consortium GitHub organisation.
