## Key Principles

1. **Open Collaboration:** Repositories are public by default for transparency and sharing
2. **Clear Access Control:** WP and group leads manage permissions per project policies
3. **Quality through Review:** All changes require peer review before merging
4. **Security Conscious:** Sensitive data protection and compliance are priorities
5. **Well Documented:** Clear documentation accompanies all technical work
6. **EU Compliance:** All work acknowledges EU funding and follows consortium agreements

## Governance

These policies are maintained by the Technical Coordinator in collaboration with WP and group leads. To propose changes:
