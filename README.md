3. **Quality through Review:** All changes are peer-reviewed before merging to maintain high standards.
4. **Security Conscious:** Sensitive data protection and compliance are priorities
5. **Well Documented:** Clear documentation accompanies all technical work
6. **EU Compliance:** All work acknowledges EU funding and follows consortium agreements
