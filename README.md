## WEBUILD Consortium Structure

The WEBUILD consortium uses GitHub for collaborative technical development across multiple Work Packages:

- **WP4 Groups:**
  - QTSP Group
  - Trust Infrastructure Group
  - Semantics Group
  - Wallet Providers Group
  - Interoperability Test Bed

Each group maintains its own repositories while following consortium-wide policies and guidelines.

## Key Principles

1. **Transparency:** All repositories are currently public, promoting open collaboration
2. **Hierarchical Access:** WP/Group leads manage team access and permissions
3. **Quality First:** All contributions undergo review before merging
4. **Security Conscious:** Sensitive data protection and compliance are priorities
5. **Well Documented:** Clear documentation accompanies all technical work
6. **EU Compliance:** All work acknowledges EU funding and follows consortium agreements

---

## Document Conventions

Throughout these documents, you'll find:

- **Best Practices:** Recommended approaches
- **Important Notes:** Critical information requiring attention
- **Checklists:** Step-by-step procedures
- **Examples:** Practical illustrations
