## WEBUILD Repository Structure

The WEBUILD project organizes its code and deliverables into different types of repositories. Each repository falls into one of three categories:

| Repository Type                | Description                                                         | Examples                                        |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Group-specific repositories**   | Owned by a specific  group; contains that group’s code or deliverables. | `wp4-qtsp-group`, `wp4-wallets-group`           |
| **UC-specific repositories**    | Created for a particular Use case.             | `wp3-pa2-consumer-payments`, `wp2-bu5-issue-micro-credentials` |
| **Task-specific repositories**    | Created for a particular task, work package deliverable, or component.             | `wp4-architecture`, `eudi-wallet-rulebooks-and-schemas` |
| **Shared collaboration repositories** | Used by multiple groups or the whole consortium for shared standards, tools, or templates. | `webuild-github-policies`, `wp3-technology-standards` |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Open Collaboration:** Repositories are public by default to encourage transparency and sharing.  
2. **Clear Access Control:** WP and group leads manage permissions according to project policies.  
3. **Quality through Review:** All changes are peer-reviewed before merging to maintain high standards.  
4. **Security Conscious:** Sensitive data protection and compliance are priorities
5. **Well Documented:** Clear documentation accompanies all technical work
6. **EU Compliance:** All work acknowledges EU funding and follows consortium agreements

- **Best Practices:** Recommended approaches and tips.
